# Stage 1/8: 2+2
## Objective
Write a program that reads two integer numbers from the same line and prints their sum in the standard output. Numbers can be positive, negative, or zero.

## Example
The example below shows the input and the corresponding output. Your program should work in the same way. Do not add extra characters after the output!

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.
